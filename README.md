<!-- Note by Toybur -->

<!-- 

Special Note: The line numbers below those could be little change.


1. Made a section in about available_call page line no 338-346. it was missed in your code. And there will be a select tag. that will be your work. line no -343

2. Change Week style.

3. Added 2 media query style for Weeks and content-container class line no 99 and 261.


4. I Changed availabel_call(2) full page code. And made it modal system. For your understanding plese check the full page. Modal contaent in line no 316-350. In line no 324-327 i think you need to change those lines. There will be a input field, i am not sure. I left it for you.

5. First of all I changed full code of call_meeting and conference_meeting page. don't worry. there was lot of mistakes in code. the code was not ready for made responsive. That's why i needed to changed full code. but your id name that you used in your code, i didn't changes your id name and place. The id have exactly place where you keeped. Overall acctually i did not change the code. I rearranged the codes.What i have changed is, line no 411-418 of both pages. I made new buttons replace your call and conference buttons. The button that you did. That was too much complecated for responsive and sorting. That's why i changed it. Now you can use a class name to be sure which button will be active. But i did not delete your code. just left it by comment. So that you can use it if you want. There have another changes in style. That is line no 186-197. That style for button active or inactive. and the style are connectd by code of line no 411-418. I created the class name by my name. so that you can understand. if you want you can Change the class name in both places. 
(This Commet for call_meeting and conference_metting both pages. Beacause both pages code are same wihtout some changes). If you have any confusion let me know.


6. I also changed full structure and made some new line of code in callEarning, conferenceEarning and referralsEarning page. all of 3 pages codes are same the difference is title name of card and activation of menu. I used a class for show it as active. new code line is 107-119.
(This note for all of 3 pages of callEarning, conferenceEarning and referralsEarning.) if anything will need to change.let me know.

7. In Create conference page i had to deleted your datepicker div. because that was unnecessary. I made a new div and arranged it in line no 331-344. Hope you like it. I created one more extra share button for desktop responsive purpose. Desktop share button in line no 308-312 and mobile share button in line no 389-393. Also i had to created a div for "Set Reminder" in line no 348-351. This part was not in mobile design. But its available in desktop design.So i thought that was a mistake of design. then kept it for both design. if you don't want it for mobile then use this class ("hidden sm:flex items-center justify-between px-5 py-2 shadow-lg rounded-full w-full sm:w-1/2") replace current classes (all classes).


8. Carefully check the EditProfileTeacher page. There have lot of changes. I had to made lot of new code according your design.Which was not available in your code before. And i also made 1 more css class named "inactive" and changed little code of javascript for active and inactive toogle function. So i repeat that please check full codes of the page and match it with the design. One more things, You have to change the select options as you need.  If you feel discomfort to understand then knock me. In line no 205-231 have a optional design. according to figma design there have 2 design for this page. in one page this features is available and in other page this design is not available. So i did it. It's your opinion that are you keep it or not.


9. In viewProfileStudent page i can see a extra button for "Start a chat". I think you don't need both. Spite I did the code for the extra button in line no 83-89. And i kept it with a comment. If needed, uncommetn it and use it else remove it. as your wish.

10. For the Teacher-book-call page i saw 2 design in figma file. but i get 1 html file for the design. so i did it according to you html file. and added two button for set availability and share availbility.
