<!-- 
1. Made a section in about available_call page line no 338-346. it was missed in your code. And there will be a select tag. that will be your work. line no -343

2. Change Week style.

3. Added 2 media query style for Weeks and content-container class line no 99 and 261.


4. I Changed availabel_call(2) full page code. And made it modal system. For your understanding plese check the full page. Modal contaent in line no 316-350. In line no 324-327 i think you need to change those lines. There will be a input field, i am not sure. I left it for you.

5. First of all I changed full code of call_meeting and conference_meeting page. don't worry. there was lot of mistakes in code. the code was not ready for made responsive. That's why i needed to changed full code. but your id name that you used in your code, i didn't changes your id name and place. The id have exactly place where you keeped. Overall acctually i did not change the code. I rearranged the codes.What i have changed is, line no 411-418 of both pages. I made new buttons replace your call and conference buttons. The button that you did. That was too much complecated for responsive and sorting. That's why i changed it. Now you can use a class name to be sure which button will be active. But i did not delete your code. just left it by comment. So that you can use it if you want. There have another changes in style. That is line no 186-197. That style for button active or inactive. and the style are connectd by code of line no 411-418. I created the class name by my name. so that you can understand. if you want you can Change the class name in both places. 
(This Commet for call_meeting and conference_metting both pages. Beacause both pages code are same wihtout some changes). If you have any confusion let me know.


6. I also changed full structure and made some new line of code in callEarning, conferenceEarning and referralsEarning page. all of 3 pages codes are same the difference is title name of card and activation of menu. I used a class for show it as active. new code line is 107-119.
