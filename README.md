<!-- 
1. Made a section in about available_call page line no 338-346. it was missed in your code. And there will be a select tag. that will be your work. line no -343

2. Change Week style.

3. Added 2 media query style for Weeks and content-container class line no 99 and 261.


4. I Changed availabel_call(2) full page code. And made it modal system. For your understanding plese check the full page. Modal contaent in line no 316-350. In line no 324-327 i think you need to change those lines. There will be a input field, i am not sure. I left it for you.
